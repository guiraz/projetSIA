NAME : Projet SIA (ShaderToy)
AUTHOR : Guillaume RAZIMBAUD
DATE : 05/04/2013

PRINCIPLE : Creates an application generating a window displaying two triangles that fills entierly the window.
            Thereby we can apply GLSL fragment shaders from the website www.shadertoy.com on those triangles.

COMPILATION : use the CMakeLists.txt to generate a MAKEFILE with cmake

EXECUTION : ./main [shader_index]
                where shader_index is the index of the wanted to be display shader, between 1 and the amount of available shaders
                
KEY EVENT : 'r' -> Change to grey brick texture
            'g' -> Change to red brick texture
            '+' -> change to next texture
            'ECHAP_KEY' -> exit program
            
MOUSE EVENT : some shaders uses mouse event.

SHADERS: most of shaders were taken directly from the website but the last one is from my creation. :)
