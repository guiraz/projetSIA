NAME : Projet SIA (ShaderToy)
AUTHOR : Guillaume RAZIMBAUD
DATE : 05/04/2013

PRINCIPLE : Create an application generating a window displaying two triangles that fills entierly the window.
            Thereby we can apply GLSL fragment shaders from the website www.shadertoy.com on those triangles.

COMPILATION : use the CMakeLists.txt to generate a MAKEFILE with cmake

EXECUTION : ./main [shader_index]
                where shader_index is the index of the wanted to be display shader, between 1 and the amount of available shaders
